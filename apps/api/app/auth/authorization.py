app/auth/authorization.py

Authorization helpers — enforces that users can only access their own data.

Rules:
  - Authenticated users: can only read/edit trips where trip.user_id == clerk_id
  - Guest trips (user_id = None): accessible by anyone (by job_id or trip_id)
    until the user claims them after sign-up
  - Shared trips: readable by anyone with the share_token (no auth required)
  - Cross-user access always returns 403 — never 404 (avoids enumeration)
